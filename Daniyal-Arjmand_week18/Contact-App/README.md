## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/contact-management-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/contact-management-app.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd contact-management-app
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   Create a file named `.env` in the project root.
    -   Add the following line to it. This tells the application where the mock API is running.
        ```
        VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/contacts
        ```

5.  **Set up the Mock API Server:**
    This project uses `json-server` to store data.
    -   Create a file named `db.json` in the project root and copy the following structure into it:
        ```json
        {
          "contacts": [
            {
              "id": "1",
              "Name": "John",
              "LastName": "Doe",
              "Email": "john.doe@example.com",
              "Phone": "09123456789",
              "Category": "Colleague",
              "Gender": "Male"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    -   Now, run the `json-server` on port `3001`:
        ```sh
        json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
        ```
    -   Keep this terminal window open.

6.  **Run the Application:**
    Open a new terminal and run the following command to start the main application using Vite's development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your project will now be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## üèóÔ∏è Code Structure

-   **`src/context/Context.js`**: The heart of the application; contains the state management logic (`useReducer`), the context provider (`ContactService`), and all API call functions (CRUD operations).
-   **`src/Components/Home.js`**: The main landing page component. It serves as a dashboard, displaying the total number of contacts and providing navigation to the "Add Contact" form and the "Contact List" view. It also contains the dark mode toggle.
-   **`src/Components/Inputs.js`**: The form for adding and editing a contact. It includes dynamic validation, success/error banners, and input feedback icons.
-   **`src/Components/ContactList.js`**: The component that displays the list of contacts. It handles search functionality, selection for bulk deletion, and triggers modals for edit/delete confirmations.
-   **`src/Components/Modal.js`**: A reusable modal component for displaying confirmation, error, or success messages with different styles based on the context.
-   **`src/utils/validation.js`**: A utility module that exports the `validateForm` function, containing all the validation logic for the contact form.
-   **`src/App.js`**: The root component that sets up the `ContactService` provider, making the global state and dispatch functions available to the entire application.
